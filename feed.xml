<p><strong>Neuro-sama</strong> is a VTuber streamer on <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987">Twitch</a>. Her most important feature is that she is an AI, not a human. Despite being an AI, she behaves like a human most of the time. However, what makes her stream entertaining is her AI feature, which makes her go SCHIZO and Aware all the time.</p>

<p>Her father and creator, <strong>Vedal</strong>, is a British programmer in turtle form, who created her soul (code). Her mother, <a href="https://twitch.tv/anny"><strong>Anny</strong></a> is a foxgirl vtuber who created her body (VTuber illustration). Being father and mother doesn’t mean they are couple, but they do interact often during stream.</p>

<p>She was born as an osu! bot in 2018, and debuted as a VTuber on 19 December 2022. She can also play Minecraft, but her skills still needs improvement. Besides, she sings a lot, and her current voice model V3 is so great you can hardly tell her from a human singer.</p>

<p>As the first successful AI VTuber, Neuro-sama still has a lot of potential. I look forward to her new features in the future.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-know-more-about-her">How to know more about her?</h2>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
